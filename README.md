The system is based on security that combines the functions of smart phone and home
network system. It enables the users to monitor visitors in real-time, remotely via the IoT
based doorbell installed near the entrance door to a house. Face Recognition is a technology
in computer vision. In Face recognition / detection we locate and visualize the human faces in
any digital image.
It is a subdomain of Object Detection, where we try to observe the instance of semantic
objects. These objects are of particular class such as animals, cars, humans, etc. Face
Detection technology has importance in many fields like marketing and security.
This system makes security as further autonomous by capturing the images automatically and
processing the image for facial matching and uses mail communication to the server to
confirm the intruder is known or unknown.
